      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>Education is at the centre of our intervention in the life of every child. Beyond the benefit of socio-economic inclusion education gives, it offers the chance to make tomorrow better starting with children the society almost left behind. We believe there is an unusual value in their experience-the possibility to transmute disadvantage into an intellectual curiosity and creative energy to find the answers to the problems that previously held them back. 
 
Our education initiatives address problems such as access and quality of learning for under-represented children. We eliminate barriers to the classroom, reintegrate housing insecure children into schools. Our accelerated education programmes, literacy campaigns and afterschool help children who have missed out on the most or all of foundational education catch up and get the leverage they need for lifelong learning.

      <h1>Care and Rehabilitation</h1>
      <p>Our first intervention in the lives of children is ensuring their wellbeing. The displaced, abused, neglected or orphaned child often requires the basic amenities for living and a chance at survival for any other intervention to be sustainable. 

Through an in-centre care programme, we cater to children at risk and provide for their basic needs such as shelter, food, clothing and medical care. Our goal is to assist every child recover from the trauma of negative life experiences and rewrite a new story for themselves as they return to a healthy life in a safe and loving home environment. 
 
Currently, we have three residential learning centres in Lagos, Ibadan and Igboora. All our centres are government-approved in every state we operate. Our approach at every centre is the same. We work for the total development of every child including character, spirituality, creativity and personal responsibility. Our work would not have been done by merely meeting children’s needs for survival alone. Importantly, we want to see them discover their identity and a sense of meaning and role in recreating the future of their country.

      <h1>EMPOWERMENT</h1>
      <p>Our desire is for every child to be free to make the right life choices and take up the power to pursue these with personal responsibility and self-determination. As children discover self-worth, we support them to also discover their power to break through the limits and overcome the sense of defeat, powerlessness and lack of influence over their own situations. 

Education is at the core of our empowerment strategy. That is why the goal of our education initiatives goes beyond bare literacy but focuses on providing access to information and training that help the children to question their world and experiences as they become aware of how they can use their own abilities and the resources available to them to improve their own lives and change the world. 

We provide life skills training to children and empower them with valuable skills in technology and various vocational fields including music, fashion, arts and creativity. Ultimately, we believe empowering the child has a direct impact on lifting households and communities from poverty. This is the way we address the broader issues of inclusive economic growth, social order and security.

      <h1>FAMILY EMPOWERMENT</h1>
      <p>While we empower the individual child to discover the greatness within, we adopt creative approaches depending on the peculiarities of each case to empower families to address domestic poverty and other imbalances that may negatively impact the development and interest of the child. Our desire is to build viable households where children can live and thrive.

Women are at the heart of our family empowerment strategy. In most cases, we find that women hold the best possibilities in efforts to reposition the household to protect and provide for the children.
