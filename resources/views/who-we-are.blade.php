<h1>Our Cause</h1>
<p>At The Destiny Trust, we are all about the wellbeing, education and empowerment of homeless children and other classes of young people in disadvantaged circumstances. 


We are committed to one cause: enabling every child to be the best he or she can be regardless of where he or she was born. We give children at-risk a new start, nurture them and hold their hands into the future through our integrated initiatives which focus mainly on using education to create tangible empowerment and lifting children from extreme poverty and conditions that hold them back. Our desire is to see them thrive, pursue lifelong happiness and purpose.

<h1>Our Approach</h1>
<p>
Our initiatives are designed to enable us come through for the children in areas where they need us most. While education is the centrepiece of our work, we provide a holistic care programme which guarantees shelter, food, protection and all basic needs to categories of children who need a safe and stable home environment to benefit from the transformative potential of our education initiatives. 
<br></br>
We collaborate and promote efforts and solutions that break down barriers on childrenâ€™s way to greatness. We do not have all the answers. Sometimes children teach us how. By being attentive to them, we learn new ideas and innovative approaches that help us to deliver solutions that are both relevant and sustainable.

<h1>Why we invest in children</h1>
<p>We believe children hold endless possibilities to recreate a better future for our society. Indeed, the future of our society can only be as great as what we make of the children today.
<br></br>
This is why we are big on their wellbeing, education and empowerment. With this, we are breaking the span of transgenerational poverty, rescuing children that would be left behind and building them into valuable human capital that Africa would need to thrive in the future. 
<br></br>
Together, we can touch more lives; we can be the hope of that one child that could become a menace to the society without a timely intervention providing care, education and empowerment.
